When preparing for a visit, the nurse queries the MAR for the scheduled administrations, obtaining a bundle of records. The nurse then performs the care activities and registers the results in the device. Upon synchronization of the device and the institution, the results of administration are uploaded to the EHR, thus updating the MAR."
